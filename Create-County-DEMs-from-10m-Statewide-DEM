# Below is Python script I created to use the Extract by Mask feature in Arcpy on a 10m DEM of the State of Oregon by each county, 
# resulting in a series of county-based DEMs that can be added (or removed) from ArcGIS mapspace, resulting in smaller more manageable 
# workspaces than a large, statewide DEM that may not be appropriate to use for a localized geographic area.
