# Kyles-repository

This is my repository.

I'm going to use this to share code that I've finished, or snippets that I'm playing around with.

I'm not a coder by nature. I took my very first coding course over a year ago. I'm completing a GIS technical certificate, and having the ability to wrap my mind around coding is essential when it comes to the world of mapping data.

I'm also new to the world of GitHub. Feel free to add comemnts or send me messages!

Thank you!

Kyle
