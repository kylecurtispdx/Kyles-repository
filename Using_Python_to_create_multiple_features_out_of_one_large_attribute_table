# Sometimes you want to extract data from a large attribute table, and it's incredibly easy to do a "Search by" attributes, select the features that satisfy your parameters, 
# and export the data is a feature layer. But what if you want to make feature layers out of ALL of the entries in the attribute table? It would be incredibly time-consuming 
# to select each feature and then export data. I came up with the following Python script to go through the attribute table of a map of counties in the State of Oregon, 
# creating individual features for each county. This script could be altered as necessary to fit file naming process, and also to make sure to select the correct field name 
# of what you want the search cursor to reiterate through.

import arcpy

# Set paths
input_layer = "C:your\input\file\here"
output_gdb = "C:your\output\geodatabse\here"

# Use a Search Cursor to iterate through unique county names
with arcpy.da.SearchCursor(input_layer, ["altName"]) as cursor: # Use the correct field name you want the cursor to go through
    for row in cursor:
        county_name = row[0].replace(" ", "_")  # Sanitize name if needed
        arcpy.FeatureClassToFeatureClass_conversion(
            input_layer, output_gdb, county_name, f"altName = '{row[0]}'"
        )
